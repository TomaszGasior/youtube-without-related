YouTube without related
===

Plugin for WordPress which removes related videos from YouTube player automatically embedded in posts by WordPress.

This plugin works by showing black overlay above YouTube player when video is stopped or paused.

Original idea of using overlay above YouTube player was suggested by [Maximillian Laumeister](https://www.maxlaumeister.com/blog/hide-related-videos-in-youtube-embeds/).
